Accurate identification of medicine vials is crucial for emergency medical services, especially for vials that resemble one another but have different labels, volumes, and concentrations  .



# Accurate Medical Vial Identification Through Mixed Reality: A HoloLens 2 Implementation

This project introduces an advanced system for real-time detection and identification of medical vials using Microsoft HoloLens 2 and Mixed Reality (MR) technology. Designed for high-pressure medical environments, this solution enhances patient safety by reducing the likelihood of vial misidentification.
